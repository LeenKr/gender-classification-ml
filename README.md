# Gender Classification – Machine Learning Project

## Overview
This project implements a **machine learning model for gender classification** as part of an **Artificial Intelligence course**.

The goal is to design, train, and evaluate a model while following good machine learning practices such as data separation, evaluation, and ethical considerations.

This repository focuses on **code, experiments, and results**.  
The dataset is intentionally **not included** for privacy and size reasons.
